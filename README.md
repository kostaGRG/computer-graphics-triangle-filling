# Computer Graphics: Triangle Filling
## Intro
This project is created for the university class named Computer Graphics at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh).

## Task: Linear Regression Function
Create a function that implements linear interpolation between two three-dimensional values C1 and C2 based on the two-dimensional coordinates of two points x1 and x2 of the vertices of a triangle.
value = interpolate_color(x1, x2, x, C1, C2)
where:
* x1 and x2 are the corresponding components of the two-dimensional coordinates of two vertices of a triangle (either horizontal or vertical coordinates).
* C1 and C2 are the three-dimensional color values corresponding to the coordinates x1 and x2.
* x is the point at which interpolation will be applied.
* value is the result of linear interpolation between C1 and C2.
